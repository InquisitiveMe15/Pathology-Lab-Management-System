**Here, user ID will be pre-filled as user don't know whether a particular ID exists or not so he can use the one provided by the database itself.**
It has all the verifying features like if the user submits a partially filled form then a warning will be shown and also the ID unique feature is also implemented.
After successfully adding a patient a **green** colour alert will be there that the patient is added successfully and the ID will automatically increment by one.
